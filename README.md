# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Script

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Project Setup and Technology Used:

---

To solve the given problem, I used the following technologies and tools:

1. React A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. Material UI: A popular UI component library for React that provides pre-styled components and themes.
3. create-react-app: A tool that sets up a basic React project structure with all the necessary configurations and dependencies.

### NPM Packages Used:

---

1. react-router-dom: A package that provides routing capabilities for React applications.
2. react-shimmer-effect A package that enables the creation of shimmer-loading effects for UI elements.

### Time Spent Breakdown:

---

Based on the provided information, here is a breakdown of the time spent on different tasks:

1. User Interface (UI) Development: 6 hours
2. API Integration: 1 hour
3. Documentation: 3 hours
   Total approx 10-12 hours

### Solution Approach:

---

1. Project Setup: I used the create-react-app tool to set up the initial project structure. This tool provides a ready-to-use React project with all the necessary configurations.

2. UI Development: I utilized Material UI to create the user interface. Material UI offers a wide range of pre-styled components that can be easily customized and integrated into React applications. By leveraging these components, I built the desired UI for the project. This project is fully responsive.

3. API Integration: To fetch data from an API, I used the built-in fetch() function provided by modern web browsers. This function allows making HTTP requests and receiving responses. I implemented the necessary API calls to retrieve the required data.

4. Shimmer Loading Effect: While fetching data from the API, I used the react-shimmer-effect package to display a loading effect that mimics the structure of the data being loaded. This provides a visual indication to the user that content is being fetched and helps improve the user experience.

5. Documentation: Finally, I spent 3 hours creating documentation for the project. The documentation includes details about the time spent on different tasks, technologies used, npm packages utilized, and an overview of the solution approach.

Overall, I followed a structured approach, utilizing React and Material UI for UI development, fetch() for API integration, and react-shimmer-effect for displaying loading indicators. The project was set up using create-react-app, and detailed documentation was created to capture all the relevant information.
